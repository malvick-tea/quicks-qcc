/*
 * qcc — source buffers and source locations
 *
 * Responsibility
 * Own the bytes of a unit of input (a file loaded from disk, or an in-memory
 * buffer used by tests) and translate a byte offset into a human 1-based
 * (line, column) location. Every later stage (lexer, preprocessor, parser) reports
 * problems in terms of byte offsets into a qcc_source; the diagnostics module
 * turns those into "file:line:col" messages with a source-line excerpt.
 *
 * Design choices (and why)
 *   - The buffer is NUL-terminated one byte past `size`. A guaranteed sentinel
 *     lets the lexer peek one byte ahead at end-of-input without a special case
 *     on every read, which removes a whole class of off-by-one bugs.
 *   - A precomputed line-start index is built once at load time. Converting an
 *     arbitrary offset to (line, column) is then an O(log n) binary search
 *     instead of an O(n) rescan per diagnostic. This is the "earn the depth"
 *     trade-off: a little more code now for predictable behavior at scale.
 *   - The C standard library is used for file I/O here. That is permitted for
 *     host tools as a *seed* dependency, to be replaced by qlibc when the
 *     toolchain self-hosts (Quicks-Meta/docs/adr/0009-...).
 *
 * Standard: ISO/IEC 9899 (C11). Uses only the portable, POSIX-free subset.
